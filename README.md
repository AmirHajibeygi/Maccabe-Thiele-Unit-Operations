# Maccabe-Thiele-Unit-Operations
The McCabe-Thiele method is a graphical tool to design distillation columns for binary mixtures, determining the number of ideal stages using equilibrium and operating lines. It assumes ideal conditions and cannot model non-ideal behavior or multicomponent systems, limiting its real-world applicability
